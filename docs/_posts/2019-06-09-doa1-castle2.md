* Two locations on the map have long series of secret doors.
  They lead nowhere.
* Most of this map leads nowhere.
* A default message, "TEXT 00", seems to have been left in by mistake.
  It can be found at the end of the longest series of
  secret doors.

  map. It contains a single scroll of Eagles View.
