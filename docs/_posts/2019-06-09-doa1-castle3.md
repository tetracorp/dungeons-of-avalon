### Notes

* Completing this level requires you to wade through the top-right corridor
  with a monster encounter on every single square. You must fight 26 in all
  in order to reach the button necessary to unlock part of the path to proceed.
* In addition, you need to either press the button in the southeast of the map,
  _or_ both the northwest and southwest. There's no reason to do both.
* This is the only level of the game with no treasure chests.
* The German version of the first riddle has a different meaning: "Your enemies
  bind you with my iron links. What is my name?" The answer is "chain".
* There are no chests on this level, but there is one assigned to the level in
  the chest list. It contains powerful items but is unused.
