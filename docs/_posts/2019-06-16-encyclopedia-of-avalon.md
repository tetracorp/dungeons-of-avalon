The following is an encyclopedia of setting lore relevant to the world of
_Dungeons of Avalon_. Some of this might help you solve puzzles if you get
stuck, or feel like understanding the lore better. Alternatively, you can just
use it for your Dungeons & Dragons campaign or something.

### Kingdoms and places

Avalon
: Once a land of sun and fragrant meadows, the conquest of this realm by the
wizard-tyrant Rhateph led to an era of magically-induced winter which covered
the land in snow. Following the overthrow of the Dark Lord, which restored the
realm's climate to its normal state, Avalon's imperial aspirations grew and the
kingdom expanded to encompass the isle of Isla.
One of the realm's rulers was King Leander. In the past, the
rulers Isodor and the isle of Rachon have also occupied the throne of Avalon.

CT
: A realm once ruled by King Walter, who once had his castle in Ghale.
What CT stands for is unknown except to historians or those who wish to
undertake some research, but it may be related to the wizard Hakan.
_(Probably a reference to CompuTec, the game's publisher.)_

Ghale
: A major city of Avalon. Founded by the tyrant Rhateph, who forced the local
people to construct his great castle. Monsters and evil folk from neighbouring
realms settled around this castle, establishing the city known as Ghale.
It was home to an inn named Skulls Taverne.
The former King Walter of 2D and CT also made his castle here, and it is for him
that the Castle of Rhateph is alternatively nicknamed.
Following the overthrow of the Dark Lord by adventurers, the King of Avalon took
Ghale as his capital.

H'Khan
: A small city of Avalon, famed for its hospitality. It is connected to the city
Ghale via a dangerous and complex series of underground passages. During the
Dark Lord's rule over Avalon, H'Khan was geographically protected by a mountain
range.
It was home to an inn named Dragon's Cave, where the heroes who defeated
the Dark Lord famously met.

Isla
: A city on an island a great distance from Ghale, at the edge of the growing
Empire of Avalon. Originally founded as a strategic outpost, its value as a
well-positioned trading outpost soon made it one of the richest cities in the
empire. It is home to an inn known as the Red Tankard, and the city is protected
by a complex fortress known as the Tower of Roa.
The dungeons beneath the city of Isla are used as a prison, but the catacombs
beneath them are the burial place of seven former rulers of Avalon.

Isodor
: A realm whose rulers once shared the throne of Avalon: King Ragt, Queen Schan
(or Queen Shan), and Prince Lean.

Rachon
: A realm whose rulers once shared the throne of Avalon: King Mithos and Queen
Liss.

2D
: A realm once ruled by King Walter, who once had his castle in Ghale.
What 2D stands for is unknown except to historians or those who wish to
undertake some research, but it may be related to the wizard Hakan.
_(Probably a reference to Double Density, a scene group name used by
the game's programmer.)_
