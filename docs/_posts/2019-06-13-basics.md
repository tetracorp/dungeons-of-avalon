While much of the game is self-explanatory, the German-only game manual for
_Dungeons of Avalon_ includes some useful information that's not necessarily
obvious to the player. I've collected this below and added a few notes of my
own, but no spoilers.

### Creating a new character

When creating a new character, you can click the "New" button above the
top-right of the character stat window to repeatedly re-roll the character's
starting stats until you get ones you like.

Once you create a new character, you still have to load them into your party
from the "load character" menu.

See [race and class](../game/race-and-class.html) for a run-down on their
specific statistics.

### Basic statistics

Your six ability scores are chosen randomly. As in many RPGs, they increase with
character level.

* IN: Intelligence.
* DX: Dexterity.
* WI: Wisdom. Spellcasters need this to learn new spell levels.
* LU: Luck.
* ST: Strength.
* KO: Kondition.

Obvious to players familiar with RPGs, but with a few quirks:

* EXP.: Experience points. You do not automatically level up, but must return to
  a city and pay The Wise Three to train you. The manual doesn't mention that
  different classes need different amounts of XP to level up.
* GOLD: The amount of gold coins held by this particular character. To buy
  something, you may need to Pool All Gold at a shop, which will give one
  character all the party's gold.
* LP: Life points, or hit points. It's also shown in the yellow bar.
* MP: Magic points, or mana. Shown in the red bar.

A new character's starting gold, LP and MP are chosen randomly, but modified by
race. A new character will start at level 1 with zero XP. The default starting
characters that you can load from disk are already at a higher level.

The manual also says there's a stat called Runen-Level, but this doesn't appear
in the final game:

> The rune level is zero because you have to teach your hero to read runes
> later.

On the second stat page (click the left/right buttons above the top-right of the
character window), two further stats appear. Due to a bug, their names appear to
be the opposite of what is expected.

* WC: Armour Class. Improved by wearing armour, rings, helmets, etc.
* AC: Weapon Class. Improved by wielding weapons.

Both WC and AC are affected by the character's physical condition.

### The city

The item shop, identified in the manual as specifically a weapon shop or arms
dealer, also lets you identify unknown items. However, no unidentified items
appear in _Dungeons of Avalon_, so you will never use this feature.

The temple can heal your wounds, but charges more based on the number of life
points to be healed and the experience of the character to be healed.

The temple can also resurrect slain party members. However, this doesn't
automatically cure any wounds or status effects they had, such as poison. You
can also resurrect a set of bones found in the dungeon by dragging it into an
empty party member slot and having it resurrected at the temple.

The trainers must be paid to increase in level, and to learn a new level of
spells. You must have acquired the requisite amount of XP to level up, and must
have reached the required level to learn new spells.  Every second level unlocks
the ability to learn new spells. It's possible to be turned down for new spells
because your Wisdom is not high enough. The maximum character level is 16.

### The dungeon

You can discard any item simply by clicking it in inventory, and then clicking
on the dungeon floor. After that, it's gone for good.

Squares with a "C" logo on them are safe spots where you can camp (rest). This
recovers LP and MP for free. There are no time-sensitive game elements, so
resting is a cost-effective way to heal up.

The compass direction you're facing is shown at the top of the screen. Note that
since the graphics for this were never updated to English, East is represented
by the letter "O" (for the German, Ost).

The manual mentions "spinners", squares which change your facing when you step
on them. These can be frustrating as they may cause you to walk back the way you
came, walk into a wall, or assume that a misclick or bug caused an incorrect
input somehow. Pay attention to your compass direction.

The manual also mentions antimagic (squares which dispel your ongoing spell
effects), teleporters (which bring you to another teleporter) and switches
(including wall switches, which can be clicked to toggle, or floor switches,
which toggle when their square is stepped on).

There are other dangers and secrets, but I'll omit them here since the manual
does not mention them. My advice is to pay attention and click on things.

### Combat

The combat system is largely self-explanatory.

Monster encounters are often divided into groups of monsters. This is
significant if you have a [spell](../game/spells.html) which targets a group of
enemies, rather than all enemies.

The first number in a monster line is the number of monsters in that group. All
monsters in a group will be of the same type. The second number is its distance
in metres.

According to the manual, "parry" is mainly useful when your character can't hit
anything, such as when they're in the back row and their weapons can't reach. It
increases the character's ability to defend themself. Note that it's not a
counter-hit system, as the term "parry" is sometimes used to mean in modern
video games.

Fleeing gives the enemy advantage and lets them attack directly, without
allowing the heroes to fight back.

NPC characters can be raised from bones, which can be found in the dungeon,
dragged into an empty character slot and resurrected in a temple as normal. NPCs
act automatically in combat and do not gain XP. According to the manual,
"A good NPC can help a group get better experience points", which may suggest
that XP is divided between non-NPCs only. You also cannot observe or change an
NPC's inventory.

### Spells

Spells cost MP, which can be recovered by resting at a camp site.
