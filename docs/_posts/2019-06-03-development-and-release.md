_Dungeons of Avalon_ was a series of two computer roleplaying games released
in 1992 for the Commodore Amiga.

### Development

Work on the original _Dungeons of Avalon_ began no later than 1991, with an early
alpha build of that game completed in May of that year. The primary developers
were coder/artist Hakan Akbiyik of newly-formed group A-Cron (later named Zeret)
and musician/artist Rudolf "Rudi" Stember of group Cyberstyle. The duo had
worked together on other games, including _The Curse of Ra_ (Oct 1990),
Commodore 64 title _Cylogic_ (Apr 1991), and Amiga puzzle game _Log!cal_ (May
1991).

In terms of development time, file dates place the completion of Zeret's
previous game _Log!cal_ on 24 May 1991. Development of _Dungeons of Avalon_ was
clearly already underway at this point. An [early
alpha](../secrets/early-alpha-version.html) build of _Dungeons of Avalon_ is
file-dated to 8 May 1991 in the early hours of the morning. The user interface
is functional, but it lacks art, dungeon layout, and audio.

Based on file dates in the completed official English release, the game's sound,
music, and most of its art were completed by 26 December 1991, 233 days later.
On 28 January 1992, both English and German game text was complete, along with
the end graphics (unattainable due to [a bug](../secrets/doa1-ending.html)) and
final dungeon graphics.

At this point, the team Zeret had now risen to four members: Hakan, Rudi,
bugtester Christian Awizio and Andre Willms, who had worked with Hakan and Rudi
on _The Curse of Ra_. Additionally credited are Frank Matzke of CAT! for monster
sketches, Klaus Ehrhardt for the monster art, and Thomas Jakowatz for the final
level design, with additional thanks to Thomas Scholl (who worked with Akbiyik
on _Log!cal_) and Michael Niedecken.

By 7 Feb 1992 the English game executable and dungeon map were finalized. The
final end credits were now updated to the copyright date of "91/92" instead of
91, and a sequel is teased.

On 17 Feb 1992, 286 days or just over 9 months after the alpha, the final
English release was complete. It is likely that the German build was completed
on the same day.

The end credits indicate that _Dungeons of Avalon_ was written in HiSoft Devpac
Assembler, a popular choice for commercial Amiga games at the time.

The game's title image appears to have been created with something like
[Vista Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJaW3K3HDQ), a procedural
terrain generation program. The same system was used extensively in some other
Amiga games, such as Lee Bamber's
[Weapon Masters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuNIDZyel5I).

A sequel, _Dungeons of Avalon II_, was already planned by the first game's
completion, and would be complete by 17 July 1992, five months later.

### Publication

Contrary to popular belief in the English-speaking Amiga community, the
_Dungeons of Avalon_ games were never released into the public domain, but were
distributed exclusively as coverdisks with some Amiga magazines. Pirate releases
and miscommunication led to the English release being redistributed in PD
channels.

The first _Dungeons of Avalon_ was released on a coverdisk with the
[April-May 1992 issue](https://www.kultboy.com/magazin/4214/)
of _Amiga Fun_, a German magazine published by CompuTec Verlag. A copyright
notice in the game manual indicates that CT Verlag may have published exclusive
rights to publish _Dungeons of Avalon_, although Zeret retained the trademark on
the title.

Like many Amiga games of this era, pirate copies of _Dungeons of Avalon_ were
distributed almost immediately. Pirate group Tequila released a version on 13
Mar 1992, plausibly the same day the April issue hit newsstands.

On 2 April, prior to the official English-language release, pirate group
Paradise rushed out a release of an unofficial English translation, created by
patching the German pirate release. Unfortunately, decompressing the program to
modify it required deleting other files to make room, leading to a bug that
prevented the dungeon from loading correctly on a new game. The translation was
also poorly done.

This bootleg translation found its way to the editors of UK magazine _Amiga
Mania_, who were authorized to release the English version of _Dungeons of
Avalon_ with their [July 1992 issue](http://amr.abime.net/issue_422). However,
this magazine issue displays screenshots of the bootleg translation, suggesting
the magazine didn't receive the English disk in time. At least one distributed
version of _Dungeons of Avalon_ dated 30 April 1992, perhaps the deadline for
the July issue, simply strips the pirate cracktro from the bootleg.

Whether _Amiga Mania_ #4 actually distributed the bootleg by mistake, or
actually released the official English version, is uncertain. The correct
English version did at some point see release.

The sequel, _Dungeons of Avalon II: The Island of Darkness_, was released in
German as a coverdisk with the
[October 1992 issue](https://www.kultboy.com/magazin/4213/).
of _Amiga Fun_, and in English as a coverdisk with the
[October 1992 issue](http://amr.abime.net/issue_425)
of _Amiga Mania_. These issues likely hit the stands in Sept 1992.

The English version of _Dungeons of Avalon II_ was quickly pirated by group
DYTEC, who released it on 4 October 1992. A trainer, or cheat program, was added
by Palace on 6 October, who distributed it via dial-up BBS on 8th April.

An unofficial patched version of _Dungeons of Avalon II_ (English) was released
which corrected some bugs and minor spelling errors. This did not cause disk
problems, as the original executable of this game was not compressed like its
predecessor.  This is made possible by _Dungeons of Avalon II_'s smaller levels:
32 x 32 squares instead of 50 x 50.

On 15 October 1992, author Hakan Akbiyik created a slightly updated version of
the German executable which fixes one bug. This version also has six very high
level starting characters, perhaps intended for testing the game. _Amiga Games_
magazine later distributed this edition of _Dungeons of Avalon II_ on its
"Sonderausgabe 1/95" magazine CD-ROM in September 1995, and released an unknown
version of DoA2 on a CD-ROM again in May 1996.

Despite being a copyrighted game, the English releases of _Dungeons of Avalon_
and _Dungeons of Avalon II_ were widely distributed as public domain disks.
It's possible that they were mistaken as such as the English versions did not
include a manual, and as such gave no indication of their publisher. Many
versions also stripped the cracktro simply by deleting it from the
startup-sequence, which might otherwise have identified it as pirate commercial
software.

### Reception

In May 1992, Amiga Joker
[reviewed](https://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&id=17539)
the original _Dungeons of Avalon_, giving it a score of 72%.

In November 1992, Amiga Joker 
[reviewed](https://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&id=1684)
_Dungeons of Avalon II_, giving it a score of 70%.

In 1993, in SynTax diskmagazine issue 27, Bill Commons
[reviewed](http://www.syntax2000.co.uk/issues/27/avalon1.rev.txt)
_Dungeons of Avalon_, saying "I have been playing this game now for seven weeks
and I am absolutely hooked on it." The reviewer was unable to defeat the final
boss.

In September 1997, P A Hardy of SynTax diskmagazine issue 51
[reviewed](http://www.syntax2000.co.uk/issues/51/avalon2.rev.txt)
_Dungeons of Avalon II_, which the group mistook for public domain. The review
notes a bug regarding NPC encounters, which makes the game impossible.

In 2015, The CRPG Addict played _Dungeons of Avalon_, reviewing it in four parts
([part 1](https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2015/08/game-196-dungeons-of-avalon-1991.html),
[part 2](https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2015/08/dungeons-of-avalon-breaking-mold.html),
[part 3](https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2015/08/dungeons-of-avalon-defeated-with-final.html),
[part 4](https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2015/08/dungeons-of-avalon-better-not-to-know.html)).
He praised the "grotesque and beautiful" graphics, but criticized the
interface. The final score was 31/100, "recommended", the highest-scoring
diskmagazine game to date and an average score overall. He was unable to defeat
the final boss without cheats.

In 2020, The CRPG addict played _Dungeons of Avalon II_, reviewing it in 2 parts
([part 1](https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2020/01/game-352-dungeons-of-avalon-ii-island.html),
[part 2](https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2020/01/dungeons-of-avalon-ii-summary-and-rating.html)).
He criticized the linear dungeon layout, but again praised the monster graphics,
rating the _Dungeons of Avalon_ series in the top 5% of monster graphics out of
360 games he has played. He rated the game 30/100 overall. Due to bugs, he was
forced to switch to the German version, and was unable to pass the door which
requires resurrecting the NPC thief Rahven, a feature only mentioned in the
German manual.
