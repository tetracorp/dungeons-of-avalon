### Notes

* Chest 0A, which contains a dagger, actually appears three times.
  This means that once you take the dagger from one of the chests,
  the other two suddenly become empty. This is because the game treats them as
  separate instances of the same chest, rather than separate chests.
* This is the only level in the game which requires Key 3.
  Exactly 3 Key 3s appear in chests in the game, all on this level,
  and there are 3 doors which require it, all on this level.
