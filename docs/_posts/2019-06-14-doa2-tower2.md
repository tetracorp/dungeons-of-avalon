### Notes

* The door marked "1c" (decimal 28) is unique. It can only be opened by a thief
  of level 28 or higher, which is well above the maximum attainable character
  level. However, the NPC thief Rahven is level 32. He can be recruited in one
  of two ways:
  1. Rahven's bones are found on this level, in chest 04 on the left of the map,
  behind a message describing the grave of Zels, King of Thieves. You need
  Levitation to avoid sliding past the entrance and a level 5+ thief to lockpick
  the door. Drag Rahven's bones into an empty party slot and he becomes a dead
  party member, who can be resurrected back in town.
  2. One of the [German versions](..history/version-differences.html#dungeons-of-avalon-2-german)
  starts with higher-level characters in the tavern, including the level 32 NPC
  thief Rahven. The other characters are Raymon, Phantic, Mion Jeh, Hakan, and
  Lady Shr, all level 16.
* Chest 0A, which contains a dagger, actually appears three times.
  This means that once you take the dagger from one of the chests,
  the other two suddenly become empty. This is because the game treats them as
  separate instances of the same chest, rather than separate chests.
* This is the only level in the game which requires Key 3.
  Exactly 3 Key 3s appear in chests in the game, all on this level,
  and there are 3 doors which require it, all on this level.
