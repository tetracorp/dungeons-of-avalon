### Race descriptions

The following descriptions are translated from the German game manual.

__Humans:__ These humans are not comparable to the typical person of our society.
They are sturdier, stronger and tougher and correspond in structure to an Armold
S. This race is very common on Avalon and thus forms the largest part of the
population. Humans are the average.

__Elves:__ The elves are a breed of their own. They live in forests and in their
own cities. They are graceful and tender beings, who stay away from the other
races on Avalon. The elves follow their own laws and would never submit to
humans or other races. Their talent for magic is only surpassed by their vanity
over other races. But they can become very strong allies in an emergency.

__Half-elves:__ Elves would deny that there are half-elves, but they exist. Half
elves are hybrids between humans and elves. These have all the talents of their
parents, but they are not quite so pronounced as the elves, although a half-elf
can be as strong as their human parent.

__Dwarves:__ The Dwarfs are a race on Avalon who honor and respect every other
race, or say, almost all. Well, the Gnome does not fall under this privilege.
Again, history is baffled why that is. Dwarfs are tougher than humans, they also
have more sense of magic. There were many great fighters and healers in the
Dwarven ranks.

* The _Dungeons of Avalon II_ manual adds: "...though they are sometimes too
hot-headed."

__Gnomes:__ Gnomes are smaller than dwarfs; "even smaller" they will think now,
but it was. The Gnomes have a very high dexterity. This may be because these
creatures steal everything. A gnom would now say "found something someone lost."
There is no door lock to a gnom. However, one should not expect strength from
these creatures.

__Trolls:__ The trolls are an artificially created race. They were created
thousands of years ago by powerful mages to protect Avalon. They have been given
a lot of strength, but for that, we still do not know if it was mischief of the
magicians or was done to protect the other races, very little in intelligence.
Trolls are not very mobile. No one knows until today how the trolls multiply,
but it is rumored that it would be ... but no, let's let this be here. 

__Stemb&auml;rs:__ Erhm yes, what should I say to this race now. Hmm yes. (Here
the author takes a deep breath, his health may depend on the following lines.)
The Stemb&auml;rs are a race of origin unknown. Evil tongues say they came from
the Earth. They are strong and have a talent for music, but that's not important
because we do not have a bard as a class in this RPG. Before I write myself
dead (in the truest sense of the word), I prefer to describe the last race.

__Lizzards:__ This is probably the most mysterious race on Avalon. As for
ancestry and way of thinking, this race is a mystery. But no one would
contradict me when I say that this race has strength, intelligence, and magical
talent. Lizzards are very rarely accepted as allies by the other races, which is
probably due more to their appearance than to their talents.

### Class descriptions

__Fighter:__ The fighter enjoys a high reputation on Avalon. It is a profession
that requires a certain amount of Strength and Dexterity. A fighter can use
almost all weapons, with only the knight still beating him in this area. The
fighter specializes in melee combat, which is only surpassed by the monks. A
fighter is more agile than a knight.

* In _Dungeons of Avalon II_'s manual, the fighter is instead said to require
high Strength and Kondition.

__Thief:__ The thief does not enjoy the high reputation of the fighter, but
does not work without him. The thief can be very useful when opening doors or
traps... A thief is characterized by speed, dexterity and intelligence. The
thief is very limited in the choice of his weapons; he can not use heavy
weapons. Nor is the thief allowed to wear metal armor.

__Hunter:__ The hunter is also a kind of fighter, whereby the hunter has
specialized more on long-range weapons, which requires a high Dexterity for the
practice of the class. The hunter, like the fighter or the knight, relies only
on his muscle power and weapon, he can not use magic like the others, unless his
weapons are enchanted.

* _Dungeons of Avalon II_ adds that the Hunter requires both Dexterity and
Kondition, and relies on his mobility and strength.

__Knight:__ The knight is arguably the most highly regarded profession on
Avalon. Every boy dreams of being a knight later on. It can be said that the
knight compares to the fighter, except that the knight has a high degree of
discipline. A knight is not limited in the choice of his weapons. He can use
almost all weapons available in Avalon.

* _Dungeons of Avalon II_ adds that the knight can wield all but a pair of
magical weapons, and is less mobile than other warriors but better protected
against attacks.

__Monks:__ The monk generally lives in the monastery and joins an adventurer
group only if he can serve with it his deity. Monks are very peaceful, but when
it comes down to it, they can become killers in melee combat. Monks learn spells
in their lives that can be used to heal or fight. Metal armor and heavy weapons
are also forbidden to the monk to carry or use.

__Magician:__ The magician is one of the most important professions on Avalon. A
magician is allowed to use only light weapons, daggers, bolas, etc. The mage
must not wear armor, or he will lose his ability to cast spells. A magician can
become a deadly weapon for his enemies.

__Healer:__ The healer is similar to the monk, with the focus of the healer's
magic on healing. His magic can be used for the attack, but is not as effective
as that of the monk.

__Wizard:__ The wizard is a kind of magician, whereby the wizard has specialized
even more on the killing of his opponents. Some say the wizards are half on the
side of evil.

### Notes

1. Due to the game's translation, the singular of "gnomes" is "gnom", an error
from German where this is the correct singular.
2. "Lizzard" is also the official translation of the race, Echse, which simply
means "lizard".
3. The "Stemb&auml;r" race description makes sense when you realise it's a
reference to Rudolf Stember, the game's musician.
4. The German name for wizard is "der Hexer", which would be more accurately
translated as "warlock".
5. The human race description describes them as like "Armold S.", a reference to
actor and bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger.

### Deleted classes

A piece of [cut content](../secrets/unused-content.html#deleted-character-classes)
included three unused character classes: Pirate, Murderer, and Bard. NPCs of
these classes still exist in the game.
