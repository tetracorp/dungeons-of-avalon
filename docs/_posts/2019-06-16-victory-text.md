### Notes

The German version of the _Dungeons of Avalon_ ending has some notable
differences to the official English text:

* The political situation of Avalon and the position of the King are much better
  explained. In the [backstory](../lore/doa1-backstory.html), which appears in
  the German-only manual, it is implied that the Dark Lord has conquered Avalon.
  The German ending clarifies that the King does still exist, but has little
  power.
* The exact amount of gold the characters receive is stated to be 20,000 gold
  pieces per character. This is exactly the amount they do receive.
* The layout of the ending screen depicting the party is explained:
  the King has ordered pictures of the heroes to be put up in the hall.
* There's an interesting situation in this scene where the heroes, having slain
  the Dark Lord, have proven themselves stronger than the King in the eyes of
  his courtiers. The king realizes this, and immediately re-asserts his
  authority by rewarding the heroes.
* In the German version of _Dungeons of Avalon_, "bones" (e.g. Elf Bones) from
  which NPCs can be resurrected are referred to as "skulls" (Sch&auml;del). The
  return of the Dark Lord's skull implies the possibility that he might return
  in a sequel.

In _Dungeons of Avalon II_:

* Lord Roa's motives are much better explained in this ending in German. As the
  son of the Dark Lord, he intended to conquer Avalon in order to avenge his
  father, who was slain by heroes from Avalon 49 years earlier. The German
  [backstory](../lore/doa2-backstory.html) also explains Lord Roa's position as
  Mayor of the relatively recently-conquered territory of Isla, which he was
  able to leverage into an attempted coup. In English, it's not even explained
  that Lord Roa is the Mayor.
