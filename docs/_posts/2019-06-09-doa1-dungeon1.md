### Notes

* The entry to this level from the starting city is in the bottom-left of
  the map.
* Most of this level is inaccessible until you have been to the second level of
  the dungeon.
* This level has more treasure chests than any other level in the game.
* In the room with three chests, the one in the northeast contains the ruby
  dagger. The others are trapped and contain nothing. The message
  "The exit is in the northeast" is a clue to this.
* You don't actually have to give Elistaire the ruby dagger to proceed.
  However, he guards a huge amount of treasure.
* The combat encounter directly north of the chest which gives a sword and 60g
  always contains 5 worms.
