### Unlimited money

A well-known exploit allows you to acquire unlimited amount of money.
This works in both DoA1 and 2.

1. Go to a shop and pool everyone's gold.
2. Dismiss everyone except the guy who has all the gold.
3. Create 5 new characters. They will each have their own starting gold.
4. Pool everyone's gold and give it to your original character.
5. Dismiss the 5 new characters.
6. Do this repeatedly and amass a lot of gold.

### Use and identify unknown items

In _Dungeons of Avalon II_, you can effectively identify some unknown items by
observing the slot they occupy when picked up. For example, picking up
unidentified arrows will automatically equip them in the character's ammunition
slot.

You can also use certain items without identifying them, such as healing
potions.

For reference, here's a list of all unidentified items in the game, their
locations (dungeon level 1 being the first level you enter from the city), and
what other items are found in their chest.

* Dungeon level 1: Wood Shield, __Unidentified Arrows__, Helmet
* Dungeon level 1: Sword, Dagger, 40 Gold, __Unidentified Permission__
* Dungeon level 1: Arrows, Knight Armour, __Unidentified Longbow__, Killmagic
* Dungeon level 1: Battle Axe, __Unidentified Warstaff__, Wood Shield, Killmagic
* Dungeon level 1: Arrows, __Unidentified Wasp Sting__, Sword, Wasp Sting, Killmagic, Killmagic
