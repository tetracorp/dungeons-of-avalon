### Unlimited money

A well-known exploit allows you to acquire unlimited amount of money.
This works in both DoA1 and 2.

1. Go to a shop and pool everyone's gold.
2. Dismiss everyone except the guy who has all the gold.
3. Create 5 new characters. They will each have their own starting gold.
4. Pool everyone's gold and give it to your original character.
5. Dismiss the 5 new characters.
6. Do this repeatedly and amass a lot of gold.
