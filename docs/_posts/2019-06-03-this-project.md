_Exploring the Dungeons of Avalon_ is a project to disassemble and analyze the
executable and data files of the 1991 Commodore Amiga roleplaying game _Dungeons
of Avalon_, and its 1992 sequel _Dungeons of Avalon II: The Island of Darkness_.

It also intends to research the mysterious origins of the game's publication and
translation into English.

It follows a similar project, [Exploring
K240](https://tetracorp.github.io/k240/), which performed an analysis of the
1994 space sim _K240_.

### What can we learn?

This project primarily intends to discover the following:

1. Can _Dungeons of Avalon 1_ be completed?
2. What are the game's mechanics?
3. What is the complete game map?
4. When was the game released and translated into English?
