### Fighter

* __XP (fast)__: L2: 140, L3: 315, L4: 700, L5: 1190, L6: 1890, L7: 2800,
L8: 4200, L9: 5600, L10: 7700, L11: 10500, L12: 14000, L13: 18200,
L14: 21700, L15: 24500, L16: 28000
* __Races:__ Any

The Fighter can wield any weapon and wear any armor except the spellcaster-only
Arc's Boolas, Firedagger, Wizard-staff, Magic-staff, Healing Robe, and the
Magician-only Ruby Dagger. He shares this with the Knight, but has faster XP
levelling.

### Thief

* __XP (average)__: L2: 160, L3: 360, L4: 800, L5: 1360, L6: 2160, L7: 3200,
L8: 4800, L9: 6400, L10: 8800, L11: 12000, L12: 16000, L13: 20800, L14: 24800,
L15: 28000, L16: 32000
* __Races:__ Human, half-elf, troll, gnom, stemb&auml;r

The thief is critical for lockpicking, but has a more restricted item use than
the Fighter, Knight, or Hunter. They can use the sword, club (DoA1), warhammer
(DoA2), and crossbow, and use the Dragonslayer (DoA2), and can wear armour,
buckler, and Sefer's Helmet.

However, they are forbidden from several items, including all +4 weapons/armor
and all named items except Sefer's Helmet. This notably excludes Killersword,
Deathbringer, and Fire Shield.  They also cannot use the mace, warstaff, battle
axe, metal shield, power helmet, or battle helmet.

### Knight

* __XP (average)__: L2: 160, L3: 360, L4: 800, L5: 1360, L6: 2160, L7: 3200,
L8: 4800, L9: 6400, L10: 8800, L11: 12000, L12: 16000, L13: 20800, L14: 24800,
L15: 28000, L16: 32000
* __Races:__ Human, elf, half-elf, dwarf, troll, stemb&auml;r

Like the Fighter, the Knight can wield any weapon and wear any armor except the
spellcaster-only items. The Knight Armour (+3) and Broadsword (+4) are exclusive
to both Knight and Fighter.

### Hunter

* __XP (fast)__: L2: 140, L3: 315, L4: 700, L5: 1190, L6: 1890, L7: 2800,
L8: 4200, L9: 5600, L10: 7700, L11: 10500, L12: 14000, L13: 18200,
L14: 21700, L15: 24500, L16: 28000
* __Races:__ Human, half-elf, dwarf, troll, gnom, stemb&auml;r, lizzard

The Hunter can wield any items except the spellcaster-only items, Knight Armour,
and Broadsword. However, they can use magic items of equivalent numerical
bonuses: Ara's Armour (+3), Killersword, Deathbringer, and Arc's weapons (all
+4).

### Monk

* __XP (slow)__: L2: 180, L3: 405, L4: 900, L5: 1530, L6: 2430, L7: 3600,
L8: 5400, L9: 7200, L10: 9900, L11: 13500, L12: 18000, L13: 23400, L14: 27900,
L15: 31500, L16: 36000
* __Races:__ Human, elf, half-elf, dwarf

The monk suffers most of the same item restrictions as the thief. They are
further restricted from using the buckler, armour, club, warhammer,
Dragonslayer, Sefer's Helmet, and any crossbow.

They can, however, use the sword. They can also wield Arc's Axe. As a
spellcaster, they're able to use the spellcaster-specific Arc's Boolas,
Firedagger, Wizard-staff, Magic-staff, and Healing Robe.

### Magician

* __XP (slow)__: L2: 180, L3: 405, L4: 900, L5: 1530, L6: 2430, L7: 3600,
L8: 5400, L9: 7200, L10: 9900, L11: 13500, L12: 18000, L13: 23400, L14: 27900,
L15: 31500, L16: 36000
* __Races:__ Human, elf, half-elf, gnom, lizzard

The magician is the only character class in _Dungeons of Avalon_ which can use
the Ruby Dagger.

Otherwise, the Magician has the same item restrictions as the monk, except that
they cannot wield the sword. These restrictions are common to spellcasters.

### Healer

* __XP (average)__: L2: 160, L3: 360, L4: 800, L5: 1360, L6: 2160, L7: 3200,
L8: 4800, L9: 6400, L10: 8800, L11: 12000, L12: 16000, L13: 20800, L14: 24800,
L15: 28000, L16: 32000
* __Races:__ Human, elf, half-elf

The healer can, unusually, wield Kel's Crossbow and Kel's Arrows, but not the
base Crossbow. It is the only spellcaster which can wield them. It otherwise has
the same restrictions as other spellcasters.

### Wizard

* __XP (slowest)__: L2: 200, L3: 450, L4: 1000, L5: 1700, L6: 2700, L7: 4000,
L8: 6000, L9: 8000, L10: 11000, L11: 15000, L12: 20000, L13: 26000, L14: 31000,
L15: 35000, L16: 40000
* __Races:__ Human, gnom, lizzard

The wizard has the same item restrictions as other spellcasters.

### Unused NPC-only classes

As detailed in [Cut or unused content](../secrets/unused-content.html), there
are three unused character classes: Pirate, Murderer, and Bard. They are still
used for the NPCs Beard (Pirate), Hanibal (Murderer), Clint (Bard), and Flint
(Pirate). As NPCs do not gain levels and cannot change items, they have no XP
progression or item proficiency tables.

### Valid race/class combinations

While the troll and stemb&auml;r have a value for MP increase at level-up, they
can not take any spellcasting classes, and therefore can never actually gain MP.
