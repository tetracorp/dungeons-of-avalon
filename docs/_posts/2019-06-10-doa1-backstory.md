The following backstory is translated from the German version of the manual.

### Text

It was a land of sun and fragrant meadows, the land of Avalon. People lived
happily ever after in their small town of H-Khan. They went about their daily
business with joy and were hospitable to every stranger who visited their
country.

So it happened that one day a magician visited this beautiful land and
gratefully accepted the hospitality of the inhabitants. But people did not know
what terrible intent this wizard was seeking their land. Soon they realized that
this master of black magic would only bring disaster and ruin on their peaceful
land. But they were too weak to do anything against him.

So he began to tyrranize the people of Avalon. He crowned himself the ruler of
this land and killed anyone who made even the slightest attempt to overthrow his
rule. Through his magical power he had the opportunity to blackmail the people.
He enchanted the country in a cold snowy landscape and threatened to destroy
everyone's belongings if he did not do what he ordered.

He let the poor people build a castle, which he protected by an entangled
labyrinth. By now his power was so great that no one dared to drive him out of
the country. Rather, creatures of the underworld came from all gentleman
countries to submit to him and live in his kingdom. They settled and built a
city of evil around his castle called Ghale. So they controlled the evil
wizard's labyrinth and protected him from anyone who entered his realm with
heroic intent.

So it happened that the wise sorcerer Arakus set out to banish the evil sorcerer
Rhateph from his kingdom and put an end to the curse of the cold. But on the way
through the labyrinth to the city Ghale he was attacked by robbers and killed.
His secret of how he wanted to defeat the evil Rhateph, he hid in the Dungens
through hidden and cryptic riddles, so that an equally good magician would
finish his task and free the land Avalon.

People went off to fathom the mystery of Arakus, but no one could interpret
and understand the puzzles correctly.

But now is the time to stop the evil rule and find the rune that can save the
land of Avalon.

The people have gathered to provide five volunteers who will banish the dark
ruler forever and forever from his evil realm. Now it's up to you to choose the
right people and lead them through the dark labyrinth on their hard way. Make
your decisions wisely, and the land of Avalon can be saved ...

### Notes

1. It says here "H-Khan", though in the final game the city's name is written
   H'Khan. It's a clear reference to the name of the game's author, Hakan.
2. The "land of snow" storyline is referenced in an unused graphical effect
   appearing in an [early alpha version](../secrets/early-alpha-version.html)
   of the game. At the title screen, which shows a mountain range, clicking
   the mouse button causes the mountaintops to turn white.
3. If Rhateph overthrew the king and crushed all rebellion, then who is the king
   that the party reports to in the ending credits?
4. It appears that at some point after this backstory was written,
   Arakus was renamed to Kham. No mention of Arakus is made in the game itself,
   and he fills the same role as Kham.
5. "Kham" may be another reference to Hakan, the game's creator.
6. It's possible that Arakus is a reference to
   [Ara](https://csdb.dk/group/?id=1028), founding member of German demoscene
   group [Argon](https://csdb.dk/group/?id=1028). _Dungeons of Avalon_
   musician Rudolf Stember was also a member of this group.
   "Ara" is also mentioned in the game with the items Ara's Shield and
   Ara's Armour, and appears in the early alpha as the namesake of the Temple
   of Ara.
7. The backstory refers to "five volunteers" because in the early alpha, the
   party contained only five characters. This is another suggestion that this
   backstory was written before the final game.
