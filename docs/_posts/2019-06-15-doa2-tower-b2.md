### Notes

* The English version of _Dungeons of Avalon II_ has two bugs that make this
  level impossible to complete: all random monster encounters freeze the game,
  and the new push button blocks don't push. In the German version, the blocks
  work correctly but the freeze bug still happens. The solution in both cases
  is to play the Sonderausgabe 1/95 German release (see
  [Differences betwen releases#Dungeons of Avalon 2 (German)](../history/version-differences.html#dungeons-of-avalon-2-german). You can port your English save
  game file over, and then play in German until you reach the doors which
  require keys, after which point there are no more random encounters, only
  the final boss (which works correctly in DoA2, unlike the
  [ending of DoA1](../secrets/doa1-ending.html)). You should then be able to
  fight the final boss in the English version to see the end credits in English.
* There are 53 traps in this level, ammounting to 44% of the traps in the
  entire game. 38 of traps on this level are flames "comming" from the side
  walls. However, a lot of these are used to spell "END" on the map, and many
  of those are inaccessible.
* This map uses a new type of small buttons (the teal blocks on the map here).
  Pressing them once toggles the button, but pressing them a second time turns
  them into Forcefields which are defeated using Killmagic scrolls. While there
  are 6 Killmagics in chests on this level, you only really need 2: one to
  walk through Button 00 to reach Button 04, which unlocks the third zone;
  and one in the third zone itself.
  * This level is divided into three zones, each of which is only accessible
    from the level above. The center stairwell leads to buttons 01 and 03, the
    right stairs lead to buttons 00, 02, and 04, and the bottom-right stairs
    lead to the final boss. Buttons 01, 02, and 03 are necessary to unlock
    buttons 05, 06, and 07 to progress.
  * It's technically possible to beat the level with only one Killmagic.
    North-south map looping means you can march from the central zone up
    through a wholly unreasonable number of traps, up through the letter
    N, and enter the route to the final boss. Button 04 is easy to miss
    because it's behind Button 00 and hidden walls. The other four buttons
    have nothing behind them except a random monster square, and Button 00
    looks the same until you press it twice, use a Killmagic, fight the
    monster, and then explore the square. Luckily, there are enough
    Killmagic scrolls to explore all five and still have one left to
    dispel the last forcefield.
* You don't need to take the north branches from the horizontal corridor with
  the wall messages. The three buttons are all Button #8, which is already
  unlocked. There are monster encounters, but you probably already hit max
  level on your whole party.
* This is the only level in the game with doors that require Key 1. There are
  six such doors. Six of Key 1 can be found in chests in this game, all of them
  in the previous level.
* This level loops North-South, although it's not possible to loop indefinitely.
  Looping is used to allow for the rooms with buttons 5, 6 and 7.
