# Exploring the Dungeons of Avalon

This project performs an analysis of the 1992 Commodore Amiga roleplaying games
_Dungeons of Avalon_ and _Dungeons of Avalon II: The Isle of Darkness_. Its aims
are to reveal the inner workings of the game series and to record its history.

The project's findings include complete maps for each dungeon level, a major
reveal of the normally inaccessible _Dungeons of Avalon 1_ win screen, an
analysis of the save game format, an index of cut or unused content, a
retranslation of game lore from the original German release, and a partially
annotated disassembled executable for _Dungeons of Avalon II_.

All findings are published on the website here:

See also [Exploring K240](https://tetracorp.github.io/k240/) for an analysis of
the 1994 space sim.
